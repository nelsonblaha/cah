startpoint /games/create receives JSON containing game ID and users' info like:
  {id:1,users:[{id:1},{id:2}]}

As part of create callback, Game sends messages back intended for users containing direction URLs with tokens to access the game:

Users visit the game show page via link, no login

Scope properties:
  newBlack: at start, all black cards
  newWhite: at start, all white cards
  hands: array containing an array for each player with player's id and cards
  oldBlack: array containing an array for each player with player's id and black cards they've won
  oldWhite: at start, all  
  activeBlack: black card being played against
  activeWhite: white cards being played against activeBlack
  activePlayer: id of player choosing black card
  (not global) myId: the id of the client

Each client connecting to the game show page deals itself in, creating new arrays for itself in hands and oldBlack and issuing 7 cards to its hand from newWhite. 

When activeWhite is equal to number of players minus one, the activePlayer is prompted with activeWhite and prompted to choose a winning white card. Cards are distributed accordingly by the activePlayer client, and activePlayer client changes activePlayer's value to the next player in the hands array.
